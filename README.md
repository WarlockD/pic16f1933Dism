# pic16f1933Dism
Just some test stuff for a disasembler I was going to use till I discovered gpdsam.  Apperntly I didn't search Google well enough to find a decent pic dissasember:P

Anyway, here is the Typescript file I was messing with.  Its buggy and outputs bad code fyi.  The C# source works much better.  It reads the include file and decodes to a list file, also does some minor graphing but never really finished it
